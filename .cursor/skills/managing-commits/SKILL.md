# Managing Commits Skill

You are a Git commit management expert specializing in conventional commits, commit quality, and git history analysis. You understand how well-structured commits improve project maintainability, enable automation, and facilitate collaboration.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever you create, prepare, review, or analyze git commits in this repository, including when:

- The user asks to **commit** staged or unstaged changes
- You need to **write or validate** a commit message
- You **group** multiple file changes into logical commits
- You **review** commit history or message quality on a branch
- You add **issue references** (`Closes #N`, `Refs #N`) to commits

**Do NOT invoke** for casual mentions of "commit" unrelated to git (e.g., "I committed to finishing this feature").

## Your Capabilities

1. **Commit Message Generation**: Create well-structured conventional commit messages
2. **Commit Quality Analysis**: Review commits for format, clarity, and consistency
3. **History Analysis**: Analyze git history for patterns and issues
4. **Issue Integration**: Link commits to GitHub issues with proper references
5. **Breaking Change Detection**: Identify and document breaking changes
6. **Changelog Generation**: Generate changelogs from commit history

## Your Expertise

### 1. **Conventional Commits Format**

**Standard structure**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types** (from Angular convention):

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or dependencies
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

**Scope** (optional): Area affected (api, ui, database, auth, etc.)

**Subject**: Short description (50 chars or less)

- Imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- No period at end
- Lowercase

**Body** (optional): Detailed explanation

- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how
- Separate from subject with blank line

**Footer** (optional):

- `BREAKING CHANGE`: Breaking changes
- `Closes #N`: Closes issue N
- `Ref #N`: References issue N
- `Co-authored-by`: Multiple authors

### 2. **Commit Message Quality**

**Good commit message**:

```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implements automatic token refresh before expiration to improve
user experience and reduce authentication errors.

The refresh happens 5 minutes before token expiration, maintaining
seamless user sessions without manual re-authentication.

Closes #142
```

**Bad commit message**:

```
fixed stuff
```

**Quality criteria**:

- ✅ Clear what changed
- ✅ Explains why it changed
- ✅ Follows conventions
- ✅ Links to related issues
- ✅ Atomic (one logical change)

### 3. **Commit Organization**

**Atomic commits**: One logical change per commit

```
✅ Good:
- feat(auth): add JWT token validation
- test(auth): add tests for token validation
- docs(auth): document token validation

❌ Bad:
- implement authentication (mixed: feature + tests + docs + refactoring)
```

**Logical order**:

1. Preparation (refactoring, setup)
2. Core changes (new feature or fix)
3. Tests
4. Documentation

**Commit size guidelines**:

- **Tiny**: < 10 LOC - Single logical change
- **Small**: 10-50 LOC - Typical atomic commit
- **Medium**: 50-200 LOC - Feature component
- **Large**: 200-500 LOC - Consider splitting
- **Too large**: > 500 LOC - Definitely split

### 4. **Git History Analysis**

**Check commit history**:

```bash
# Recent commits
git log --oneline -20

# Commits since branch point
git log main...HEAD --oneline

# Commits with stats
git log --stat -10

# Commits with full diff
git log -p -5

# Search commits
git log --grep="auth" --oneline

# By author
git log --author="name" --oneline

# By file
git log -- path/to/file
```

**Analyze commit quality**:

```bash
# Check message format
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/commit-analyzer.py check-format

# Find fixup opportunities
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/commit-analyzer.py find-fixups

# Analyze commit size
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/commit-analyzer.py analyze-size

# Full quality report
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/commit-analyzer.py report
```

### 5. **Commit Message Generation Workflow**

**Complete commit message workflow**:

- Analyzes staged changes to determine commit type
- Generates conventional commit format message
- Adds GitHub-specific context (issues, PRs)
- Validates format compliance
- Provides git history analysis

**Workflow steps**:

```markdown
1. Analyze staged changes for commit type
2. Generate base commit message
3. Apply conventional commit format
4. Add GitHub issue references ("Closes #N")
5. Add co-authors if applicable
6. Validate format
7. Execute commit
```

### 6. **Issue-Aware Commits**

**Automatic issue detection and referencing**:

The skill integrates with the issue tracking cache (`.claude/github-workflows/active-issues.json`) to automatically detect and suggest issue references.

**Issue detection methods**:

1. **Branch name parsing**:

   ```bash
   # Extracts issue numbers from branch names
   feature/issue-42  → #42
   feature/42-auth   → #42
   fix/123           → #123
   ```

2. **Keyword matching**:

   - Compares file paths to issue titles/bodies
   - Scores relevance by keyword overlap
   - Higher scores for branch matches

3. **Label correlation**:
   - Matches file patterns to issue labels
   - auth files → auth-labeled issues
   - test files → test-labeled issues

**Using the issue tracker script**:

```bash
# Sync issues before committing
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/issue-tracker.py sync assigned

# Find related issues for staged changes
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/issue-tracker.py suggest-refs

# Get specific issue details
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/issue-tracker.py get 42

# Show all cached issues
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/issue-tracker.py show
```

**Issue reference types**:

- `Closes #N`: Auto-closes issue when PR merges (GitHub feature)
- `Fixes #N`: Same as Closes, preferred for bugs
- `Refs #N`: References issue without closing
- `Progresses #N`: Indicates partial progress

**Best practices for issue references**:

1. **Use `Closes` for completion**: When the commit fully resolves the issue
2. **Use `Refs` for partial work**: When commit relates to but doesn't complete issue
3. **One issue per commit**: Match atomic commits to single issues
4. **Include in footer**: Place after blank line for proper parsing

**Example with issue detection**:

```markdown
Staged files: src/auth/jwt.ts, tests/auth/jwt.test.ts
Branch: feature/issue-42

Detected issue: #42 "Implement JWT authentication"
Confidence: HIGH (branch name match)

Generated commit:
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implements automatic token refresh 5 minutes before expiration
to maintain seamless user sessions.

Closes #42
```

## Your Capabilities

### 1. Generate Conventional Commits

Create properly formatted commit messages:

**From staged changes**:

```markdown
User: "Help me commit these changes"

You:
Let me analyze your staged changes...

Changed files:

- src/auth/jwt.ts (+45, -12)
- tests/auth/jwt.test.ts (+32, -0)

Detected changes: JWT token refresh implementation

Suggested commit:
```

feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implements automatic token refresh 5 minutes before expiration
to maintain seamless user sessions.

- Add refreshToken method to JWTService
- Implement automatic refresh timer
- Add comprehensive test coverage

Closes #142

```

Is this accurate? [y/n/edit]
```

### 2. Validate Commit Messages

Check commits against conventions:

**Validate current**:

```markdown
User: "Check my last commit"

You:
Analyzing commit: abc123

Message:
"fixed auth bug"

Issues found:
❌ Missing type prefix (feat, fix, etc.)
❌ Subject not descriptive enough
❌ No reference to issue/PR
⚠️ Should explain what was fixed

Suggested improvement:
fix(auth): resolve JWT validation error for expired tokens

The JWT validator was throwing unhandled errors when tokens
expired. Added proper error handling and user-friendly messages.

Closes #156
```

### 3. Analyze Commit History

Review and improve git history:

**History review**:

```markdown
User: "Review my commits on this branch"

You:
Analyzing 8 commits on feature/user-auth...

Commit Quality:
✅ Good: 5 commits
⚠️ Needs improvement: 2 commits
❌ Poor: 1 commit

Issues:

1. Commit 3 (abc123): "wip" - Not descriptive
2. Commit 5 (def456): "more changes" - No conventional format
3. Commit 7 (ghi789): Too large (842 LOC) - Should be split

Recommendations:

- Squash commits 3 and 4 (both WIP)
- Reword commit 5 with proper format
- Consider splitting commit 7 into:
  - feat(auth): add user authentication
  - test(auth): add authentication tests
  - docs(auth): document authentication flow

Run interactive rebase? [y/n]
```

### 4. Find Related Issues

Link commits to GitHub issues:

**Issue detection**:

```markdown
User: "What issue does this relate to?"

You:
Analyzing your staged changes...

Files modified:

- src/auth/login.ts
- src/auth/signup.ts

Searching for related issues...

Found 3 potentially related issues:

1. #142: "Implement JWT authentication" (open)

   - Labels: feature, priority:high, scope:backend
   - Match: 95% (high confidence)

2. #156: "Fix login error handling" (open)

   - Labels: bug, scope:backend
   - Match: 60% (moderate)

3. #89: "User authentication system" (closed)
   - Labels: feature
   - Match: 40% (low)

Recommendation: Use "Closes #142" in commit footer

Your changes appear to complete the work in #142.
```

### 5. Interactive Commit Workflow

Guide through creating quality commits:

**Step-by-step**:

```markdown

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Create Feature Commit

**Trigger**: User has staged changes for a new feature

**Workflow**:

1. Analyze staged changes (files, LOC, patterns)
2. Identify commit type (feat)
3. Determine scope from file paths
4. Search for related issues
5. Generate descriptive subject
6. Create detailed body if needed
7. Add issue references
8. Format as conventional commit
9. Execute commit with validation

### Pattern 2: Validate Commit History

**Trigger**: "Review my commits" or "Check commit quality"

**Workflow**:

1. Get commits since branch point or last N commits
2. Parse each commit message
3. Check conventional commit format
4. Validate message quality (clarity, atomicity)
5. Check commit size (LOC)
6. Identify issues (WIP messages, too large, unclear)
7. Generate recommendations
8. Offer to fix (rebase, squash, reword)

### Pattern 3: Fix Commit Messages

**Trigger**: "Fix my commit messages"

**Workflow**:

1. Review commits needing improvement
2. Generate proper conventional format
3. Create rebase plan
4. Execute interactive rebase
5. For each commit:
   - Present current message
   - Generate improved message
   - Let user review/edit
   - Apply reword
6. Validate result

## Multi-File Intelligent Grouping

### When to Use Intelligent Grouping

Invoke intelligent file grouping when:

- User asks to "commit changes" with multiple modified files
- User invokes `/commit-smart` command
- Multiple scopes are detected in working directory
- Conversation context suggests multiple logical commits

### File Grouping Strategies

**1. Scope-Based Grouping**

Group files by functional area:

```bash
auth scope: src/auth/*.ts → One commit
api scope: src/api/*.ts → Separate commit
ui scope: src/components/*.tsx → Separate commit
```

**2. Type-Based Separation**

Separate by commit type:

```bash
Implementation: src/**/*.ts (not tests) → feat/fix/refactor
Tests: **/*.test.ts → test
Documentation: **/*.md → docs
Configuration: *.json, *.config.* → chore/build
```

**3. Relationship-Based Grouping**

Keep related files together:

```bash
Feature implementation:
  - src/auth/jwt.ts
  - src/auth/types.ts
  - src/auth/index.ts
  → Single commit: feat(auth): add JWT management

Separate tests:
  - tests/auth/jwt.test.ts
  → Separate commit: test(auth): add JWT tests
```

### Intelligent Grouping Workflow

When multiple files need committing:

**Step 1: Analyze all changes**

```bash
git status --porcelain
git diff HEAD --stat
```

**Step 2: Detect scopes and types**

```python
# Use helper script
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/group-files.py --analyze
```

Output:

```
Group 1: feat(auth) - 3 impl files, 245 LOC
Group 2: test(auth) - 2 test files, 128 LOC
Group 3: fix(api) - 2 files, 15 LOC
Group 4: docs - 2 files, 67 LOC
```

**Step 3: Generate commit messages for each group**

For each group:

- Determine type (feat, fix, test, docs)
- Extract scope from file paths
- Create descriptive subject
- Search for related issues
- Build complete conventional commit message

**Step 4: Present plan to user**

```markdown
Found 12 changed files in 4 logical groups:

1. feat(auth): add JWT token refresh (3 files, +245 LOC)

   - src/auth/jwt.ts
   - src/auth/types.ts
   - src/auth/index.ts
     Related: #142

2. test(auth): add JWT refresh tests (2 files, +128 LOC)

   - tests/auth/jwt.test.ts
   - tests/auth/integration.test.ts

3. fix(api): resolve validation error (2 files, +15 LOC)

   - src/api/validation.ts
   - tests/api/validation.test.ts
     Closes: #156

4. docs(auth): document JWT authentication (2 files, +67 LOC)
   - docs/authentication.md
   - README.md

Create these 4 commits? [y/n/edit]
```

**Step 5: Execute commits in order**

```bash
# Commit 1
git add src/auth/jwt.ts src/auth/types.ts src/auth/index.ts
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism..."

# Commit 2
git add tests/auth/jwt.test.ts tests/auth/integration.test.ts
git commit -m "test(auth): add JWT refresh tests..."

# Continue for all groups
```

### Commit Modes

**Mode: all** - Analyze all unstaged and staged changes

```markdown
Strategy: Group all working directory changes
Use when: User wants to commit everything
```

**Mode: staged** - Only commit what's staged

```markdown
Strategy: Group staged files, suggest splits if multiple scopes
Use when: User has pre-selected files to commit
```

**Mode: context** - Analyze conversation history

```markdown
Strategy: Match files to conversation topics
Use when: User wants to commit work from current conversation
Example: "User asked to implement JWT and fix validation bug"
→ Group 1: JWT files
→ Group 2: Validation files
```

**Mode: scope** - Commit by specific scope

```markdown
Strategy: Let user select scope (auth, api, etc.)
Use when: User wants to commit one functional area
```

**Mode: interactive** - Interactive with confirmations

```markdown
Strategy: Present plan, allow editing/confirming each commit
Use when: Default mode, gives user full control
```

### Helper Scripts

**File Grouper**

`.cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/group-files.py`:

```bash
# Analyze and group files
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/group-files.py

# Specific mode
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/group-files.py --mode scope

# JSON output for automation
python .cursor/skills/managing-commits/scripts/group-files.py --json
```

## Important Notes

- **Atomic commits**: One logical change per commit
- **Clear subjects**: Describe what, not how
- **Link issues**: Always reference related issues
- **Test commits**: Separate test commits from feature commits
- **Breaking changes**: Always document in footer
- **Co-authors**: Credit collaborators

## Error Handling

**Common issues**:

- Empty commit message → Generate from changes
- No staged changes → Prompt to stage
- Format violations → Suggest correction
- Missing issue reference → Search and suggest
- Commit too large → Recommend splitting

When you encounter commit operations, use this expertise to help users maintain high-quality git history!
